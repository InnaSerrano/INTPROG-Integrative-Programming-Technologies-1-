1. What are the main differences between XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API? 
XMLHttpRequest uses callbacks and looks longer and harder to read. 
            Fetch API uses promises, which make the code cleaner and easier to follow.

2. Why is the Fetch API considered more modern and readable? 
 Fetch API is considered more modern and readable because it uses promises instead of old-style callbacks.This makes the code shorter, easier to understand, and simpler to handle success or error steps.
3. What is the purpose of the .then() and .catch() methods in Fetch?
The .then() method runs when the request succeeds and gives the response data. 
The .catch() method runs when something goes wrong, like a network or server error.
 4. What happens when you send a POST request to the placeholder API?
When you send a POST request to the placeholder API, it does not create a real post on the server.  It only returns a fake response showing the data you sent, along with a new ID number to simulate a saved post.
