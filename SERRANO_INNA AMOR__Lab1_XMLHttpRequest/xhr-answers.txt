1. What’s the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?
- readyState shows what step the request is in.
  0 – not started yet
  1 – connection opened
  2 – request sent and server responded
  3 – loading data
  4 – done, response is ready
- status shows the server’s response code.
  200 means OK, 404 means not found, 500 means server error.

2. How do you make the request asynchronous?
- Add true as the third value in xhr.open():
  xhr.open("GET", "data.json", true);
- This makes the request run in the background so the page doesn’t freeze while waiting for a response.

3. Why is asynchronous communication better for web apps?
- The page stays active while the server works.
- Users can still click, scroll, or type without waiting.
- It feels faster and smoother.
- Only the part that needs updating reloads, not the whole page.
